# Announcement 2024-09-12

This repo was originally hosted on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/mertbakir/resume-a4).
Github version is ahead of the gitlab version and introduces very small breaking changes on the config file. If you are an old user, just update your config file and you're good to go. 

I'll create a better guide explaining features and do proper versioning, just don't know when.

# Features

* Simple, easy to use, single or multi page, A4-sized Resume generator.
* Print friendly, just use your browser or save as PDF.
* Write your resume in yaml. All content stored in data files.
* Add/Remove sections order change section orders by editing `config.yaml`.
* Section names are configurable in `config.yaml`. So, you can write in any language you want.

[Here is a blog post](https://mertbakir.gitlab.io/projects/resume-a4/) about this project.

# How To Use

## Download

1. Create a hugo project.
2. Go to themes folder.
3. Clone this theme.

```
cd themes
git clone https://gitlab.com/mertbakir/resume-a4.git
```

or add as a submodule

```
git submodule add https://gitlab.com/mertbakir/resume-a4.git themes/resume-a4
```

## Start

1. Copy `config.yaml` from `exampleSite` to the root directory of your hugo project.
2. Open `config.yaml` and add your relevant information.
3. Copy `data` folder from `exampleSite` to the root directory of your hugo project. All you need is that folder.
4. Create your resume in yaml files.

## Config File

* You can add/remove sections.
* Add multiple pages as many as you like. (_still, let's not forget the aim here. a resume should be precise. I don't think a recruiter will scroll down on it._)
* Order of the "features" are important in the config file. 

### Custom CSS

Copy the ```\assets``` folder under the ```exampleSite``` directory if you like to make simple modifications.
### Avatar

Set avatar link in `config.yaml`, you may keep the image under `static` folder. You can set it as ```false``` if you don't want to add a picture.

### Publications

You can change `style` of the `publications` feature in the config file. There are options for APA and IEEE standards. Report me on gitlab or send a merge requests if standarts are erroneous. I'm no expert on citation standarts.

## Print | Save As PDF

There is a snippet in the ```exampleSite\assets\custom.scss``` file for printing the href attribute. It's not included as default. Because "save as pdf" is way more common usage than a hard copy. Also, I wouldn't prefer printing a long url on a hard copy.

If you don't like the result of "save as pdf" in Mozilla Firefox, try Chrome or a Chromium-based browser. Probably, because Firefox doesn't support [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/%40page/size).
